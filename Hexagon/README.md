# HexagonMeshGeneration

WIP

## Features

- [Make a mesh](https://github.com/ColinvD/ProefOpdrachten/blob/master/Snake/script.js)
- [Grid generator for a hexagon tile shape](https://github.com/ColinvD/ProefOpdrachten/blob/master/Snake/script.js)

## Software Analysis
WIP

## Learning Goals
What do i want to reach with this project:
- Understand how you make a mesh in unity
- Understand how to use the A* algorithm to move around the grid
- Getting some idea on how to make a outline shader

## Planning

| | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|week 1 | Research engine for making a mesh | Research how to make a mesh | Making a mesh(hexagon) generator | Hexagon tile map generator | Making a outline shader |
|week 2 | UI Input to generate field | Hexagon grid movement | Hexagon grid movement | | |
