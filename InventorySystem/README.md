# Inventory system

In this project I make a reusable inventory system where you can sort, add, remove and use the items.

## Features

- [Reusable Inventory system](https://github.com/ColinvD/ProefOpdrachten/blob/master/Hexagon/Assets/Scripts/MakeMesh.cs)

## Software Analysis

Unreal is not the best option for this because unreal is more focused to use a drag and drop system then using code. So for a assignment to make reusable code it's not that smart.
Unity can deal better with reusable code because you need to make your own code to make anything work in your game. Unity can give directly errors if something isn't right.
Javascript is only code so you can always make reusable code but because javascript is so open for anything you have less chance to find a error that you make in your code.

## Learning Goals
What do I want to reach with this project:
- To make reusable code that I might use in other projects
