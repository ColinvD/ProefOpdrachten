# Procedurally​ ​Generated​ ​Dungeon

In this project I try to make a dungeon.

## Features

- [RoomMaker](https://github.com/ColinvD/ProefOpdrachten/blob/master/Procedurally%E2%80%8BGenerated%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8BDungeon/Assets/Scripts/Room.cs)

## Software Analysis

Javascript very easy to make a 2d dungeon on a canvas, allows more things.
Unity is more clearer what you do, faster and easier to see what the code does with diffrent values.

## Learning Goals
What do I want to reach with this project:
- To understand how a dungeon gets generated
