# Snake 2D

I needed to make my own Snake 2D with HTML5 and the framework phaser.io. I needed to make sure it is playable on desktop and mobile. The game needs to fill the whole webbrowser so not fullscreen and on mobile it needed to work on landscape and portrait view. The main goal was that it needed to work well and how it looks doesn't matter.

## Features

- [Every feature is in 1 script](https://github.com/ColinvD/ProefOpdrachten/blob/master/Snake/script.js)

## Software Analysis
The assignment needed to be made with phaser.io. It's a good choise because it already has some implemented features so you don't have to write them for yourself for example the collision can be done with only 1 line of code while you normally have to do it with more.

## Learning Goals
What do i want to reach with this project:
- Understand how to code with Phaser.io
- Understand what you can do with Phaser.io
- To see if I can make the classic snake
